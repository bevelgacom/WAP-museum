# Bring back WAP from the dead!!!!

WAP sites don't deserve to be forgotten!

This repo contains all WML dumps we found from the past. Why? Because we can use these to bring them back to life! 


## Success stories

- [DB Navigator WAP](http://wap.bevelgacom.be/navigator/) - Brought back to life using the WML dump with modern backend
- [ORF ON](http://waporf.karpour.net/) - HTML and WML revived version of the old ORF WAP site
- Yours???

## License

Do whatever you want. We just place old WML dumps here to preserve them.

## To archive

> These are links we found while searching for WAP sites. We did not yet try to find their dumps. If you have any of these, please open a PR or contact us!
